# Test 1

* dir_1
    * `foo.txt` C
    * `bar.txt` R
    * `hello_world.txt` R
* dir_2
    * `foo.txt` C
    * `baz.txt` A
        
## Difference 

* Additions
    * `baz.txt`

* Removals
    * `hello_world.txt`
    * `bar.txt`

* Changes
    * `foo.txt`

## Notes

* This is designed to test what happens if the first directory is bigger, but with different items.

* Much like `test_5` but with the addition of a chance to `foo.txt`.
